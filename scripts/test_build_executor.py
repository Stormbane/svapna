"""Test the BUILD executor by running a single BUILD desire through
the full plan/execute loop — same as what `beat_once()` does after
the viveka picks BUILD and approves a plan.

This bypasses the viveka (we construct the Desire directly) and the
git-status pre-check (we acknowledge pre-existing out-of-scope dirt
in the desire text so the executor can proceed anyway).

Task: advance ROADMAP item P1.3 — create embodiment/firmware/ and
embodiment/assets/ subdirectories with READMEs explaining what goes
in each. Small, bounded, meaningful, commits cleanly.
