"""Voice bridge CLI entrypoint.

Thin wrapper around svapna.embodiment.voice.bridge — the implementation
lives in the package so it can be imported and tested. See:
  src/svapna/embodiment/voice/

Run:
    pip install -e ".[voice]"
    python scripts/voice_pipeline.py
    python scripts/voice_pipeline.py --streaming-tts
    python scripts/voice_pipeline.py --brain heartbeat

Stop with Ctrl+C (clean disconnect).
